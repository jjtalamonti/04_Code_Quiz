# 04_Code_Quiz

My objective for this Assignment was to create a working quiz that is timed. As the user progresses through the quiz they are met with diffrenet questions relating to a tiny Island in Canada, called Pelee Island.
I chose to do a quiz about Pelee because it is where I spent most of my childhood and it is very near to my heart. And the idea of using my new found skills to make a quiz based around Pelee is something I really enjoyed.
